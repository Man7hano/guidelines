# Folder Structure

In every organization folders are everywhere. They should be understandable and logically structured.

- Structure but

Therefore we define a folder structure which should be as followed:

- name: Uppercase, seperate-words-with-dashes
- format: [index]_[folderName], e.g. `1_First-Folder-Name'

   `1_First-Folder-Name`
   `2_Second-Folder-Name`
   `3_Third-Folder-Name`
   `...`
